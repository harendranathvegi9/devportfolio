	<h3>Bio</h3>
	<h5>I am an entertainer turned developer.  Being a very creative and sociable person, I have spent the majority of my adult life in both show business and customer service.</h5>
	<h5>In recent years, I was looking for a career change that would give me the intellectual and creative stimulation that I crave.  That is when I discovered web development.</h5>
	<h5>To make myself highly skilled and marketable, I attended the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp program. This is an intense, 24 week program that teaches students the skills to become successful web developers.  It was here that I was able to merge my inventiveness with technical skills in order to excel as a developer.</h5>
	<h5>I have been able to apply my unique background and experience to my career as a developer. My experience involving customer service, art, comedy, psychology, marketing, public speaking and economics have all become invaluable and useful to me. I would now love to bring my skills, imagination and out of the box thinking to you!</h5>
